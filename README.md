# Daily NBA Pick'em

## Socklord Pick'em Pool is a website I created that allows a user to make daily NBA picks and compete against other users. 

## Javascript, React, MongoDB, Bcrypt, JWT, SCSS, Node.js

## This project is a recreation of my capstone project. There was many things I didn't get right with my capstone and with more experience under my belt I wanted to do the project justice. 
### This project was created using React, SCSS, Javascript, MongoDB, JWT, Bcryptjs, and several API's.


### The picks page was the main focus of this project. I used radio buttons for the team boxes because only one radio button can be select per div, and when selecting a radio button you can change the color of the background which is a very nice way to let the user know what the clicked on. In this image, the selected teams have a yellow background while the unselected teams have a white background.

### The view picks page is nothing special (VISUALLY), but there is alot of magic happening here. First, the user can view their picks or delete them if they want to make changes. Second, the picks will always display under the correct label, despite what order the user selected the games in.

## I am having a lot of fun with this project and plan on making it better. I will add more sports in the future as well as the option for people to create their own private pools and invite their friends to them.
